      3. Professional History

      3.1 Jun. 2016 - Till Now  		<a href='https://www.traffics.de/'>Traffics GmbH</a>                         Berlin, Germany

        As a software developer in Traffics GmbH, I worked on many systems/projects; From building
        data processing tools with Scala,  APIs with Node.js, and using Python in many glue-like
        projects that facilitate the interaction between our internal systems/applications.
        In Traffics, we praise the <a href='twelve-factor app'>twelve-factor app</a> methodology which helped us build a portable
        and resilient software. Running and scaling our systems is achieved by using technologies like
        Docker, Kubernetes, ELK stack and Prometheus.

        <strong>I’m a member of the <i><a href="https://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a></i> team</strong> who is reasonable for <strong>implementing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190221195125/https://www.otds.de/en/">OTDS</a><a href="#traffics_fn1">[1]</a><a href="#traffics_fn2">[2]</a> specification and building
        Traffics’s toolchain to process the hundreds of gigabytes of the otds data that we receive daily</strong>.
        We depend heavily on testing (unit, integration and acceptance tests) to guarantee the quality of
        our code base (~30K loc). I’m also maintaining and contributing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> schemas that we use to
        <i>simplify/preporocess</i> OTDS data before feeding it to the first stage in our data processing pipeline.

        I have been a member of <strong><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node.js</a> team. We developed tens of REST APIs for internal use and one main
        REST API - <a href="http://www.traffics.de/universal-connector/">Connector</a> - that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200911093946/https://docs.traffics.de/connector/v3/">used by our b2c clients</a> everyday to search for flights,
        hotels and package offers</strong>. Traffic's customer list is quite long and it includes many big names in the
        tourism industry in Germany and Europe like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUI_Group">TUI</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTI_Group">FTI</a>. To serve our customers needs,
        scaling our services was very critical for us. Back in 2016, <strong>I was responsible for bringing <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> into
        the company</strong> and switching all our services to run on top of it and make sure that everything runs smoothly and
        scales well. To get insight about our services’ states, we collect many matrices to be stored in <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus">Prometheus</a> and later
        shown on <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana">Grafana</a>, and for a detailed insight, we used <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack">ELK stack</a> to make it easy to look into our logs.

        Beside developing the tools that we need to process OTDS data (Scala) and APIs (Node.js) to search in the processed
        OTDS data, <strong>I’m also working on introducing <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> to our company</strong>, and replacing the old processing
        tools (Perl and Bash) with Apache Airflow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">dags</a> (Python) that take  advantage of not only the nice web UI of Airflow but
        also build on top of <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/">Celery</a> and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">Rabbitmq</a> to provide more <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9902">dynamic</a> environment to executes our dags. Our focus now is
        to make sure that the hundreds of data processing jobs that we start everyday work smoothly and fast on top of
        Apache Airflow that is running in our datacenter (<strong>saving the cost of running these jobs on AWS</strong>).

        As a fun project, I developed an Amazon Alexa skill, <a href="https://alexa.amazon.de/spa/index.html#skills/dp/B0731FHP62">Reisesuche</a>, by which you could
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8HXax6ciK0">search for hotels and package offers</a> (in German) using your Amazon Echo & Alexa Devices.


      3.2 Mar. 2015 - May. 2016 		<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/sand-s.a.e.'>SAND</a>                                  Cairo, Egypt

         Part of team who heavily use Agile and XP to deliver highly scalable web applications
         based on microservices architecture using technologies like J2EE(JSF 2.x, EJB 3.x, JPA, JMS),
         spring framework, nodejs and Angularjs.

         Forked <a href="https://github.com/ubicall/node-red">NODE-RED</a> to deliver customized <a href="https://github.com/ubicall/node-red-contrib-ivr">IOT components</a> and
         developing our own VoIP and call center solutions based on FreeSwitch and Asterisk servers. Beside that,
         I used Javascript/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">Angularjs</a> to build many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single-page applications</a> and also many REST APIs using Node.js and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Expressjs</a>.

         My everyday toolbox includes Apache Solr, Mongodb, Redis, Travis, and Docker.

         Building and enhancing software solutions that deal with searching inside many terabytes of
         data using a wide range of technologies such as Apache Solr, Spring Framework, JPA, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit">GWT</a>, JSF and
         Servlet which heavily depends on Hbase, MySql and Oracle as backend storage.

         Was a part of the team who developed <a href="http://www.arrow.com/">Arrow</a> REST API which serves more than 5M requests per Month. I also worked on
         Integrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAM">OpenAM</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">Single sign-on</a> solution for all siliconexpert’s systems.
